I found Next.js much easier to grasp compared to React and I think I have met all the basic requirements of the project.
If I had more time I would improve the styling but my main focus was to get the basic functionality working.
One of the main problems I encountered was an error kept occurring when adding a new post (which wouldn't have associated comments with it). But with help from family members and Google, I managed to fix this by changing my SQL command.
Stack Overflow also came in handy when trying to solve other minor issues.
